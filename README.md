Selenium Webdriver and Unittest framework in Python

The basic building blocks of unit testing are test cases — single scenarios that must be set up and checked for correctness. In Unittest, test cases are represented by Unittest. TestCase instances - To make your own test cases you must write subclasses of TestCase or use FunctionTestCase. Some users will find that they have existing test code that they would like to run from Unittest, without converting every old test function to a TestCase subclass.

For this reason, Unittest provides a FunctionTestCase class. This subclass of TestCase can be used to wrap an existing test function. Set-up and tear-down functions can also be provided.
